# 👉 Do you want me to also configure Athena views (e.g., monthly_summary, quarterly_summary) so leadership can query roll-ups directly without writing SQL each time?

## Excellent 🎯 — let’s add Athena views for roll-ups so leadership (and FinOps analysts) can query monthly, quarterly, and yearly summaries without having to write complex SQL every time.

## 🔹 1. Base Table

From the Glue crawler, we already have:
```sql
finops_db.finops_daily_summary
(
  OU string,
  Service string,
  Cost double
)
PARTITIONED BY (BillingDate date)
```


## 🔹 2. Create Monthly View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW finops_db.monthly_summary AS
SELECT
    date_trunc('month', BillingDate) AS Month,
    OU,
    Service,
    SUM(Cost) AS TotalCost
FROM finops_db.finops_daily_summary
GROUP BY 1, OU, Service
ORDER BY Month DESC, TotalCost DESC;
```


## 🔹 3. Create Quarterly View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW finops_db.quarterly_summary AS
SELECT
    concat(year(BillingDate), '-Q', quarter(BillingDate)) AS Quarter,
    OU,
    Service,
    SUM(Cost) AS TotalCost
FROM finops_db.finops_daily_summary
GROUP BY 1, OU, Service
ORDER BY Quarter DESC, TotalCost DESC;
```


## 🔹 4. Create Yearly View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW finops_db.yearly_summary AS
SELECT
    year(BillingDate) AS Year,
    OU,
    Service,
    SUM(Cost) AS TotalCost
FROM finops_db.finops_daily_summary
GROUP BY 1, OU, Service
ORDER BY Year DESC, TotalCost DESC;
```



## 🔹 5. Terraform — Athena View Definitions

We can manage these views using aws_athena_named_query or aws_athena_workgroup. Example:
```hcl
resource "aws_athena_named_query" "monthly_summary" {
  name        = "monthly_summary"
  database    = aws_glue_catalog_database.finops.name
  workgroup   = "primary"
  query       = file("${path.module}/sql/monthly_summary.sql")
}

resource "aws_athena_named_query" "quarterly_summary" {
  name        = "quarterly_summary"
  database    = aws_glue_catalog_database.finops.name
  workgroup   = "primary"
  query       = file("${path.module}/sql/quarterly_summary.sql")
}

resource "aws_athena_named_query" "yearly_summary" {
  name        = "yearly_summary"
  database    = aws_glue_catalog_database.finops.name
  workgroup   = "primary"
  query       = file("${path.module}/sql/yearly_summary.sql")
}
```



## 🔹 6. How Leadership Can Use

Now execs can run simple queries:

Monthly spend by OU:
```sql
SELECT Month, OU, SUM(TotalCost) 
FROM finops_db.monthly_summary 
WHERE Month >= date '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY Month, OU;
```


Quarterly spend by Service:
```sql
SELECT Quarter, Service, SUM(TotalCost) 
FROM finops_db.quarterly_summary;
```
Yearly OU roll-up:
```sql
SELECT Year, OU, SUM(TotalCost) 
FROM finops_db.yearly_summary;
```


## ✅ End Result

Your FinOps stack now supports:

🚨 Real-time anomaly alerts (email)

📧 Daily spend digest (Top 10 + CSV)

📨 Daily QuickSight PDF dashboard snapshot (execs)

📂 Historical archive in S3 (partitioned by BillingDate)

🔍 Athena Views for Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly roll-ups

👉 Leadership can now get executive-ready summaries with one-click queries or directly in QuickSight.
