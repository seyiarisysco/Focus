👉 Do you also want me to split the CSV by OU (one file per OU attached), or keep it as a single consolidated CSV for all OUs?

Perfect ✅ — keeping it as a single consolidated CSV is the most practical choice:

📂 One file = easier to archive in S3, query in Athena, and track in version control.

📊 Analysts can pivot by OU, Service, Account in Excel or PowerBI.

📧 Email is smaller (no dozens of attachments).

🔍 Execs/FinOps can still filter within the CSV instead of juggling multiple files.

🔹 Example Final CSV (attached in Daily Digest)

BillingDate,OU,Service,LinkedAccount,DailyCost
2025-09-14,Marketing,AmazonEC2,Account123,7200
2025-09-14,Marketing,AmazonS3,Account456,2800
2025-09-14,Marketing,AmazonSageMaker,Account789,5400
2025-09-14,Finance,AWSLambda,Account234,1200
2025-09-14,Finance,AmazonRDS,Account567,6800
...

Covers all OUs.

Sorted by BillingDate → OU → DailyCost (descending).

Easy to filter/pivot in Excel or Athena.

🔹 Final Delivery Model (Locking It In)

✅ FinOps Team gets:

🚨 Anomaly alerts (spikes)

📧 Daily Digest email (KPIs + Top 10 + consolidated CSV breakdown)

✅ Executives get:

📨 Daily PDF snapshot (QuickSight dashboard)

📊 Visual Budget vs Forecast sheet with traffic lights

✅ Both teams have:

📂 Historical S3 archive (Athena/Glue)

🔮 Forecasting + OU-specific budget alerts

🔎 Drill-through dashboards for deep dives

👉 Now that we’ve consolidated the CSV into the digest, do you also want me to set up automatic versioned archiving of the daily CSVs in S3 (so every day’s digest CSV is retained for audits & historical analysis)?

Perfect ✅ — let’s lock in automatic versioned archiving of the daily consolidated CSVs in S3. This ensures every digest CSV is retained historically, enabling audits, compliance checks, and long-term analysis.

🔹 1. S3 Bucket Structure

We’ll store CSVs like this:

s3://finops-daily-summaries/ou-breakdowns/year=2025/month=09/day=15/ou_breakdown.csv

📂 Benefits:

Partitioned by year/month/day → Athena queries stay fast.

Easy filtering by time range.

Versioned storage for immutability (no overwrites).

🔹 2. S3 Bucket Versioning (Terraform)

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "finops_summaries" {
  bucket = "finops-daily-summaries"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "finops_summaries_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.finops_summaries.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}


🔹 3. Update Lambda to Archive Daily CSV

In your digest Lambda, after generating the OU consolidated CSV:

import boto3, os
from datetime import date

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

def archive_csv(local_file):
    today = date.today()
    bucket = os.environ["ARCHIVE_BUCKET"]
    key = f"ou-breakdowns/year={today.year}/month={today.month:02d}/day={today.day:02d}/ou_breakdown.csv"

    s3.upload_file(local_file, bucket, key)
    print(f"Archived CSV to s3://{bucket}/{key}")
    return f"s3://{bucket}/{key}"


Add inside handler() after generating the CSV:

archive_path = archive_csv(local_file)


🔹 4. Glue Catalog + Athena Table

Crawler setup so archived CSVs are queryable:

resource "aws_glue_crawler" "ou_breakdown" {
  name          = "finops-ou-breakdown-crawler"
  role          = aws_iam_role.glue_service_role.arn
  database_name = aws_glue_catalog_database.finops.name

  s3_target {
    path = "s3://finops-daily-summaries/ou-breakdowns/"
  }

  schedule = "cron(0 8 * * ? *)" # Run daily after digest
}

Resulting Athena table schema:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE finops_db.ou_breakdown (
  OU string,
  Service string,
  LinkedAccount string,
  DailyCost double
)
PARTITIONED BY (year int, month int, day int)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION 's3://finops-daily-summaries/ou-breakdowns/';


🔹 5. Example Athena Query

Query all Marketing OU CSVs for Q3 2025:

SELECT year, month, day, Service, SUM(DailyCost) AS Total
FROM finops_db.ou_breakdown
WHERE OU = 'Marketing'
  AND year = 2025
  AND month BETWEEN 07 AND 09
GROUP BY year, month, day, Service
ORDER BY year, month, day;


🔹 6. End Result

📧 FinOps daily digest includes OU breakdown CSV.

📂 Same CSV is archived in S3 with versioning → fully immutable.

🔎 Queryable via Athena (partitioned by date).

✅ Meets audit requirements (cost history is never lost).

📊 Enables long-term trend analysis and chargeback reviews.
